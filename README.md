# My Example

[Docsy][] is a [Hugo theme module][] for technical documentation sites, providing easy
site navigation, structure, and more. This **Docsy Example Project** uses the Docsy
theme component as a hugo module and provides a skeleton documentation structure for you to use.
You can clone/copy this project and edit it with your own content, or use it as an example.

In this project, the Docsy theme is pulled in as a Hugo module, together with
its dependencies:

```console
$ hugo mod graph
...
```

For Docsy documentation, see [Docsy user guide][].

This Docsy Example Project is hosted on [Netlify][] at [example.docsy.dev][].
You can view deploy logs from the [deploy section of the project's Netlify
dashboard][deploys], or this [alternate dashboard][].
